# AI Model Advisor

AI Model Advisor is a web app that helps you choose the most suitable AI model for your specific task. Powered by Google Gemini, it provides clear recommendations and detailed explanations for a wide range of AI tasks.

## üöÄ What is AI Model Advisor?

AI Model Advisor is designed to answer the question:  
**"Which AI model should I use for my task?"**

- **Describe your AI task** (e.g., "Generate an image of a futuristic city at sunset", "Translate a legal document", "Write a Python script to analyze CSV data").
- The app **analyzes your description** and suggests the most relevant AI models (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude 3, DALL-E 3, etc.).
- You get a **clear recommendation** and a **detailed explanation** of why those models are suitable.

## üñ•Ô∏è How it Works

1. **Enter your task** in the input box.
2. Click **"Get Recommendation"**.
3. The app consults Google Gemini and displays:
   - A list of recommended AI models.
   - An explanation tailored to your task.
